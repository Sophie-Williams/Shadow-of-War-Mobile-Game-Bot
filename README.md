# Shadow of War Mobile Game Bot
This is a Bot for Shadow of War Mobile Game is very basic i will post some instructions later. PLEASE read the Instructions first.
## Instructions
First, this application is very basic so dont expect much from it. I made it just for my personal use and i decided to post it here.

This bot only works on computers with android emulators with Shadow of War installed. He just clic for you when you are away doesnt make anything special.

## Requirements
I recommend you to use [NOX emulator](https://pt.bignox.com) and set it to 1366x768 or 1360x768 resolution. It was the only resolution i've made, for now. Use it wiht the window maximized, and the NOX android buttons at the bottom.

Notice that when the program is using your mouse to click you can't stop the program, i need to fix that, but it only takes like 30 seconds then when he is waiting to claim rewards you can do anything.

Dont check all the CheckBoxes, try the Skirmish first just for better understanding how it works.

To use the second job, you have to select the type, only the "Treasues" works for now, and the time it takes to make it claim. If you have not started this work, place 0 to start it immediately.

## What it Does ?
This bot was made just to gather things while you are away.
* He can auto-start Orc Job Skirmish every 5 minutes > Claim the reward > Repeat from the begining (Gives you **5 coins** every 5 min)
* He can auto-start Orc Job Treasures every 4 hours(0 to start now) or if it is already running you can tell him how much time will take to claim, > He will Claim the reward > and start it again ( Gives you **20 coins** every 4 hours)
* He will claim Spoils of war every 4 hours (0 to claim now) or you can specify how much time will take to claim it.
* You can say how much energy do you have and how much do you want him to spend while you are away > he will auto raid for you when reachs the maximum energy ( you need to have the first city completed in normal mode)
